    -   `jdbc2_0-stdext.jar` - The JDBC 2.0 Optional Package API classes (package `javax.sql` ). You will need to include this file in the `/WEB-INF/lib` directory of your application, if it is not already made visible to web applications by your servlet container.

<span id="Changes_and_Bug_Fixes"></span>Changes and Bug Fixes
-------------------------------------------------------------

The following changes and bug fixes have occurred in the configuration files related to Struts:

The following changes and bug fixes have occurred in the basic controller framework (package `org.apache.struts.action` ):

-   Modify ActionForm class to use ActionServletWrapper rather than expose ActionServlet.
-   Add ActionServletWrapper class. Used by ActionForm to prevent the Public String properties of ActionServlet from being changed via a query string.
-   Unconditionally pass the selected mapping as a request attribute under key Action.MAPPING\_KEY, even if no form bean is specified.
-   Avoid a NullPointerException in corner cases caused by failed initialization of ActionServlet.

The following changes and bug fixes have occurred in the file upload package (package `org.apache.struts.upload` ):

-   Fixed lost byte problem in BufferedMultipartInputStream
-   Fixed ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException situations
-   Better reporting for premature closing of input streams while reading multipart requests.
-   Additional fix for file corruption problem with uploads and new line characters.

The following changes and bug fixes have occurred in the utilities (package `org.apache.struts.util` ):

-   Modify RequestUtils class to use ActionServletWrapper rather than expose ActionServlet.
-   `ConvertUtils.convertCharacter()` will now detect empty strings and return the default value.

The following changes and bug fixes have occurred in the *struts-bean* custom tag library (package `org.apache.struts.taglib.bean` ):

-   Correct the generated scripting variable type when the \<bean:cookie\>, \<bean:header\>, or \<bean:parameter\> tag is used with the "multiple" attribute.

The following changes and bug fixes have occurred in the *struts.html.md* custom tag library (package `org.apache.struts.taglib.html` ):

-   Fixed FormTag to exclude query string when identifying action mapping name.
-   Correct MultiboxTagdoAfterBody() to return SKIP\_BODY instead of SKIP\_PAGE.
-   Added the 'align' attribute to the \.html.md:image\> tag.
-   On the Options tag, if the property specified by the "property" attribute returns null, it now throws an error message that indicates what the real problem is, rather than causing an NPE.
-   Added 'style' and 'styleClass' attributes for \.html.md:option\> and \<html:options\> tags.
-   Correctly URLEncode the query string parameter value on ImgTag, even if there is only a single parameter.

The following changes and bug fixes have occurred in the *struts-logic* custom tag library (package `org.apache.struts.taglib.logic` ):

-   The `.html.md:errors>` when the property tag is specified, errors are no longer printed if the specified property has no errors. Previously errors were always printed! Future enhancements would include additional attributes to always turn off the header or footer.

-   Add installation notes for Jetty.
